# ClassesAnimationsAndRedux
In this repository I try to apply to learn more about React class components while using some of the latest versions of common libraries, 
like react-navigation V5. 

Learned about:
1) Class Components basic sintax and it's component lifecicly methods; (well, check all components)
2) Animations with Animated, PanResponder, LayoutAnimation and UIManager; (check the Swipe component)
3) Redux-persist to persist (ohh) offline data; (check the store folder and the App component to see how it works)
4) Push Notifications with expo-permissions and Notifications; (check PushNotifications under services folder and the SplashScreen)

Plus:
- a lot of react-native-debugger envolved, specially for redux inspection (with redux-devtools-extension);
- dealing with maps with react-native-maps and expo;
- yes, the most modern code seems to be compatible with class components (they are not the best, but not the worst after all).
